# BikeStore-project

In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of the company's financial performance by gathering data through SQL queries. My primary objective was to derive key business metrics and assess the company's revenue trends from 2016 to 2018. To achieve this, I meticulously created SQL queries that extracted relevant data from the company's database, ensuring that I captured all necessary information for a thorough analysis.

Once I had successfully queried the data, I transferred it into Excel, a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis. In Excel, I developed pivot tables that allowed me to summarize and analyze the data effectively. These pivot tables enabled me to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the revenue figures, providing valuable insights into the company's financial health during the specified period. To enhance the visual representation of the data, I created dynamic dashboards in Excel that showcased the key metrics and trends in an easily digestible format. 

Furthermore, I took the analysis a step further by importing the tables into Tableau, a leading data visualization tool. In Tableau, I created interactive dashboards that allowed stakeholders to explore the data in real-time. 

Overall, this project not only provided a detailed assessment of the company's revenue from 2016 to 2018 but equipping stakeholders with the tools and visualizations necessary to make informed business decisions based on the data-driven insights derived from my analysis.
