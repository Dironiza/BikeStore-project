# BikeStore-project

For this project. I collected information using SQL queries to extract some business metrics and analyze the revenue of the company between 2016 and 2018. I imported the table that I queried from SQL to Excel and created pivot tables and Dashboards and I also loaded the tables into Tableau and created interactive Dashboard.
